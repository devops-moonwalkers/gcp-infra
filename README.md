## Introduction
Goal of this repo

### Setting up K8s locally
We use minikube as our local kubernetes environment. To set up Kubernetes locally, see the instructions at [minikube start](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

All the profiles configuration (see [about minikube profiles](https://faun.pub/using-minikube-profiles-def2477e968a)) can be found in the ~/.minikube/profiles folder. 
This folder along with the ~/.minikube/config/config.json file contain everything you need to know about the Minikube profiles in your local environment

For more information on how K8s can be installed locally, see [4 ways to run Kubernetes locally](https://opensource.com/article/20/11/run-kubernetes-locally)

### Allow Terraform user to access GCP
